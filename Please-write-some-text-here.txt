Hi my name is Anton Babak, I want to learn git to the full extent without it, if you understand it well I will not make any changes to the release. I do not understand git as well as I do git. So I am the default guy. If you like git you may want to read the manual there: https://gist.github.com/nolifan/68131909

Note: The main goal of this repo is to make it a bit easy to download and install your favorite Git client. I will also be adding some new features of the repo so expect a few things done in case you are interested.

Please bear in mind that I have to know that Git is my project of pride (and also, as much as possible, my own): I've taken my first steps in it. With a working version (1.6.12) and a full repository I was able to set up to play nicely with it with only one caveat: I'm running the current version. Don't worry though, this doesn't mean I am running a new one! It is my opinion and belief in what it means to be a contributing engineer in a project built on top of git.

To be honest, I'm not really used to using other projects, especially when they were released on my own branch (I also use the new repo, but it's not my project.) I tend to work independently and also as a

I want to use something with the most basic features. And my ideas will allow me to use any open standards library that comes along. Now I'm not a developer of code, but a very talented one. That's what I want with gulp.

So what does this mean in practice? I actually thought that gulp would never come online yet, because you might have to implement it by hand. I know this because I know one of the great things about gulp is that it takes many months just to make a piece of code, and this time it's really done on an open standard. There is a new feature coming soon called the TypeScript type extension.

The TypeScript type extension is great for writing new types like data , type , string , function , function etc. Just think how simple it would be to encode in JavaScript like this:
